Kong comes with a default configuration file that can be found at /etc/kong/kong.conf.default if you installed Kong via one of the official packages. To start configuring Kong, you can copy this file:
$ cp /etc/kong/kong.conf.default /etc/kong/kong.conf
Kong will operate with default settings should all the values in your configuration be commented-out. Upon starting, Kong looks for several default locations that might contain a configuration file:
/etc/kong/kong.conf
/etc/kong.conf
You can override this behavior by specifying a custom path for your configuration file using the -c / --conf argument in the CLI:
$ kong start --conf /path/to/kong.conf
The configuration format is straightforward: simply uncomment any property (comments are defined by the # character) and modify it to your needs. Booleans values can be specified as on/off or true/false for convenience.

Verifying your configuration
You can verify the integrity of your settings with the check command:
$ kong check <path/to/kong.conf>
configuration at <path/to/kong.conf> is valid
This command will take into account the environment variables you have currently set, and will error out in case your settings are invalid.
Additionally, you can also use the CLI in debug mode to have more insight as to what properties Kong is being started with:
